Quiz Buddies is a full-stack web app that allows users to create and quizzes to share with their friends, and take publically shared quizzes. Logged-out users may browse public quizzes by other users, and create and play their own - the data is saved to local storage on their device. Users may optionally log in to save their quizzes so they can be shared publically and across devices.
