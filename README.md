Escape Room Builder is a full-stack web app that allows users to create and play escape rooms. Logged-out users may browse public escape rooms by other users, and create and play their own - the data is saved to local storage on their device. Users may optionally log in to save their escape rooms so they can be shared publically and across devices.
